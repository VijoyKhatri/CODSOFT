    <h1>About India Gate</h1>
    <p>The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located near the Kartavya path on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Rajpath. It stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.</p>

      <p> This war memorial was inaugurated in February 1931. It was built in memory of more than 70,000 soldiers who fought bravely during World War I and lost their lives in the event. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, India Gate boasts an architectural style very similar to Arc de Triomphe, which stands tall in Paris.

Many years after the construction of India Gate, a small memorial referred to as Amar Jawan Jyoti was constructed under it in 1972, but it was later merged with the Eternal Flame at the National War Memorial.</p>
